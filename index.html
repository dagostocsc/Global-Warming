            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>Our planet is facing an environmental crisis driven by human activity. From the release of greenhouse
                gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, to the destruction of forests and unsustainable farming
                practices, our actions are accelerating climate change at an alarming rate.</p>

            <p>This matters because climate change affects everyone — rising temperatures lead to more extreme weather
                events, rising sea levels, food insecurity, and the loss of biodiversity. Communities around the world,
                especially the most vulnerable, are already experiencing the devastating effects of this crisis.</p>
